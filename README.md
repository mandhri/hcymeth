# Introduction
Re-analysis methylation data first described by 
[Kok et al (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4644301/)


## Aim
The aim of this work is to;

1. Asses the relationship between Homocysteine to DNA methylation patterns

2. develop the analytical pipelines required for efficient re-analysis of 450K array data,

3. confirm that we are able to obtain differential methylation results that are similar
to those obtained in the original study, and

4. critically evaluate the conclusions made in the original study.
